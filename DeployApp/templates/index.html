                <span style="color:#198b90">Deep learning</span> (also known as deep structured learning) is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on
                artificial neural networks with representation learning. Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or
                unsupervised.[1][2][3]

                <span style="color:#198b90">Deep-learning architectures</span> such as deep neural networks, deep belief networks, deep reinforcement learning, recurrent
                neural networks and convolutional neural networks have been applied to fields including computer vision, speech
                recognition, natural language processing, machine translation, bioinformatics, drug design, medical image analysis,
                material inspection and board game programs, where they have produced results comparable to and in some cases surpassing
                human expert performance.[4][5][6][7]

                <span style="color:#198b90">Artificial neural networks</span> (ANNs) were inspired by information processing and distributed communication nodes in
                biological systems. ANNs have various differences from biological brains. Specifically, artificial neural networks tend
                to be static and symbolic, while the biological brain of most living organisms is dynamic (plastic) and
                analogue.[8][9][10]

                The adjective "deep" in deep learning refers to the <span style="color:#198b90">use of multiple layers in the network.</span> Early work showed that a
                linear perceptron cannot be a universal classifier, but that a network with a nonpolynomial activation function with one
                hidden layer of unbounded width can. Deep learning is a modern variation which is concerned with an unbounded number of
                layers of bounded size, which permits practical application and optimized implementation, while retaining theoretical
                universality under mild conditions. In deep learning the layers are also permitted to be heterogeneous and to deviate
                widely from biologically informed connectionist models, for the sake of efficiency, trainability and understandability,
                whence the "structured" part
